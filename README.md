Threat Hunting Lab

A Bash-based Threat Hunting and Log Analysis project demonstrating proactive threat hunting, detection engineering, incident investigation, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping using Linux and Termux.

---

Overview

This project simulates how Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts proactively hunt for threats by analyzing authentication logs, identifying suspicious behavior, and producing investigation reports.

The lab demonstrates detection and investigation of:

- Failed Login Activity
- Brute Force Attacks
- Suspicious IP Addresses
- Privilege Escalation
- Persistence Indicators

---

Features

Failed Login Detection

Detects repeated authentication failures.

Brute Force Detection

Identifies IP addresses generating excessive login failures.

Suspicious IP Detection

Matches log activity against a known malicious IP watchlist.

Privilege Escalation Detection

Detects sudo usage, account creation, password changes and privilege escalation indicators.

Threat Hunting Dashboard

Provides a summary of all detected security events.

Investigation Report Generator

Produces investigation reports with findings and recommendations.

MITRE ATT&CK Coverage

Technique| ATT&CK ID| Description
Brute Force| T1110| Credential Access
Valid Accounts| T1078| Privilege Escalation
Create Account| T1136| Persistence
